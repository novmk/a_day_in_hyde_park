          <p>Today is Friday. Looking out of the window, the weather does not seem particularly pleasant. The sky is white, as if filled with white smoke, without a single cloud. Actually, it is more like white with about 5% grey mixed in. Usually, I enjoy going to the park on sunny days when the sun is shining brightly, but going on a cloudy day isn't too bad either. There are many parks in London, but today I decided to go to Hyde Park. I wore a white T-shirt with dark grey jeans. I also brought my film camera and my favourite green cap with me. At the bus stop, two people were waiting, it seems like the bus had not passed by yet. I think the alphabet signs at the top of the bus stops are a really good system to prevent confusion about directions. Before coming to London, I used to occasionally take buses in the opposite direction. It would be great if we had this system in our country too. I took the number 94 bus. Most buses in London have two floors, and I always sit by the window on the second floor. Because, I love the street view from the second floor. From there, I can see the top front view of tall trees, not the low angle. I like this cropped view by window, fully filled with the branches and leaves. It creates a beautiful, lively pattern against the blue sky. While gazing the view outside, I got off at Queensway Station (Stop A) bus stop.</p>
